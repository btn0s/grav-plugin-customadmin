# Grav Customadmin Plugin

This **Customadmin plugin** for [Grav](http://github.com/getgrav/grav) is, in fact, only few lines that add a CSS and a JS file to the [Grav Admin panel](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-admin).
The files are included with the lower priority in order to let you simply override everything you need to customize.
